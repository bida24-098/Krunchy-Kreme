    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Krunchy Kreme was born out of a deep love for comfort, creativity, and community. What started as a simple passion for baking and brewing quickly became a vision to bring people together over incredible food and unforgettable moments.</p>

    <p>I started this cafe because I saw a need for a space where warmth meets flavor — where every bite of a freshly baked croissant or sip of a smooth cappuccino could lift spirits. Krunchy Kreme isn’t just about coffee and pastries — it’s about building a little haven in the heart of the city where everyone feels welcome.</p>

    <p>Each item on our menu is made with hand-picked ingredients, lots of heart, and a dash of creativity. From early-morning regulars to curious wanderers, everyone finds a place here. We invite you to stop by, say hello, and savor something delicious. Welcome to the Krunchy Kreme family!</p>
